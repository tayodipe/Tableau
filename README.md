## Problem Statemtent

The Airbnb market in Seattle for the year 2016 presents an opportunity for data-driven insights and optimization. This project aims to address key questions and provide actionable recommendations for hosts and potential investors in the Seattle Airbnb business. Leveraging two core datasets, the listing table and the calendar table, I have performed an INNER JOIN to create a unified dataset, enabling comprehensive analysis.

- Average Price per Zip Code
- Best Time for Airbnb Market Entry (Revenue)
- Highest Earning Bedroom
- Average Price per Bedroom
- Competition Analysis by Bedroom Type


## Solution
